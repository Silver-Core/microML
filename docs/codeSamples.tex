Primitive operators and functions, such as head and tail are not available to the inference engine.
Therefore it was necessary to `hard code' the type signatures into the environment, thereby allowing
students to check the type signature of various important functions, but also meaning that these
functions can now be type checked\footnote{Haskell overcomes this problem partially by having almost
everything as a library function, including such things as + and -, which in microML are
primitives.}. Figure~\ref{table:typesigs}
